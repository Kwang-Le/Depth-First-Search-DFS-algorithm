# Depth-First-Search-DFS-algorithm
this is the depth first search algorithm.
Given a graph, This algorithm will visit all vertices in that graph by visiting the adjacent vertex of the starting vertex 
until it runs into a deadend(a vertex with no unvisited adjacent vertices), at which point it will then backtrack through the 
vertices on it path to a vertix with no deadend and continue to visit all the vertices.
